# Full Stack Open 2021 - Part 10

This project was completed for [part 10](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part10) of the [Full Stack Open 2021](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course from the University of Helsinki.

This repository contains the front end for a React Native application for rating Github Repositories. The pre-made back end can be found [here](https://github.com/fullstack-hy2020/rate-repository-api).

The app displays a list of all GitHub repositories that have been rated by users. The repository list can be sorted and filtered. It also allows for infinite scrolling. Users can sign up for an account and then they are able to rate and review any public repository on GitHub. The app utilizes Expo, Apollo Client, Formik, and Yup.
